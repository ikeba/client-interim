<p>
When you use our website, we or a third party use cookies to enable the functionality of the websites and to collect various useful information that we use to improve the functionality of the websites and our services. By reviewing this Cookie Policy, you can find out basic information about cookies, what functions they perform and what are your options for using them.

<h3>Definition of Cookies</h3>

<p>Cookies are small text files placed on your computer and/or device by the websites you visit. They are used to ensure the correct and/or more efficient operation of websites, as well as to provide various information to the owner of the website. Today, the use of cookies is very widespread and common in almost all websites. More information about cookies can be found <a href="https://cookiepedia.co.uk/all-about-cookies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Cookies usually do not contain any information that personally identifies the user of the website, but information stored in cookies and/or obtained through the use of cookies may be related to personal data usually stored by websites.</p>

<p> If you do not feel comfortable with the use of cookies, you can manage them through the options in your Internet browser, including removing cookies by deleting them from the search history (cache) after you leave the site. More information on cookie management can be found below. </p>
<h3>Types of Cookies</h3>
<p>Cookies can be roughly divided according to their functionalities:</p>
<ul>
  <li>„Technical (essential) cookies“ are necessary for the functioning of the website and allow the visitor to navigate through the website and use its features (for example, access to secure areas of the website);</li>
  <li>„Performance (statistical) cookies“ collect statistical data about websites for website owners, mainly to measure and improve website performance. They function in such a way that they collect data about your use of websites (for example, information about the pages you visit and errors on those pages, page loading speed, etc.), while they do not collect information that can identify you more closely;</li>
  <li>„Functional cookies“ enable websites to remember your choices regarding the use of the page (e.g., changes in font size, page personalization, etc.) or for the functioning of various additional services such as leaving comments on blogs and forums; and</li>
  <li>„Marketing cookies“ are used to select ads that will be displayed in a way to be more relevant to you and your interests. These cookies track your visits to certain websites and share this information with other organizations (website owners and advertisers).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cookie Duration</h3>
<p> Each cookie has a built-in mechanism that determines how long the cookie will be stored in your browser. </p>
<ul>
  <li>„Temporary cookies“ remain in your browser only during your visit (session) to the website and are destroyed after you leave the website.</li>
  <li>„Permanent cookies“ remain in your browser even after you leave the website, whereby their duration (hours, days, years) depends on the lifespan of each cookie. „Permanent cookies“ can be used, for example, to memorize data entered when logging into a service (so that the visitor does not have to log in again each time). They are also used to track visitor's behavior on the website in order to better understand what visitors like and what they don't like based on data collected and this allows website owners to improve website functionality. Regardless of the cookie’s built-in duration time, you can delete any cookie at any time.</li>
</ul>
